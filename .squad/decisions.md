### 2026-05-21: Solution Filter Count Scope — Selection-Scoped Toggle
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Revised `CustomApiSelector.tsx` so the Solution managed/unmanaged toggle (`showSolutions`) no longer counts as a standalone active filter.
**Why:** The toggle scopes the solution picker context, not applied record filters. Users read active-filter badges as filters that materially change the displayed record set. Collapsed badges should only show solution-related context when a solution is actually selected.
**Implementation:**
- Filter count excludes `(showSolutions !== 'all' ? 1 : 0)` calculation
- Collapsed filter badges conditionally show solution managed/unmanaged badge only when a specific solution is selected
- Custom API managed state, PowerFx, and Business Event filters remain as independent, always-visible badges
**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/CustomApiSelector.tsx`
**Build Status:** ✅ `npm run build` passed

---

### 2026-05-21: Solution Filter Scope — Approved
**By:** Ripley (Lead)  
**What:** Reviewed and approved Dallas's revision to treat Solution managed/unmanaged as a contextual picker-scope control rather than a standalone active filter.
**Why:** Parent-picker scope toggles should not inflate active-filter counts. The collapsed summary correctly now reflects only user-facing filters that materially change displayed records (selected solution, Custom API managed state, PowerFx, Business Event). Solution context is properly shown as conditional on an actual solution selection.
**Pattern / Guidance Established:**
- Parent-picker scope toggles are contextual controls, not standalone filters
- Collapsed filter summaries must enumerate only the active user-facing filter set
- Active-filter counts and visual summaries must stay in sync
- Badges serve as the shared presentation for compact collapsed-state overviews
**Files Approved:**
- `src/components/CustomApiSelector.tsx`
**Build Status:** ✅ `npm run build` passed

### 2026-05-24: React #185 Picker State Stability Fix
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Fixed React #185 (Maximum update depth exceeded) regression occurring when creating response properties after toggling tree view mode in Custom API Details.
**Root Cause:** Stale `responsePropertyQuery` cache state combined with validation cascades caused re-render loops. GenericTagPicker items instability compounded the issue during remounts.
**Solution Implemented:**
1. **GenericTagPicker.tsx** - Made stale-selection clearing callback idempotent with ref-backed guard to prevent duplicate parent state updates during remounts. Added logic to avoid clearing while option list is temporarily empty (important for modal remounts).
2. **RequestParameterCreate.tsx** - Memoized picker item arrays with `useMemo` to eliminate inline `map(...).sort(...)` arrays passed to picker.
3. **ResponsePropertyCreate.tsx** - Memoized picker item arrays with `useMemo` matching pattern in RequestParameterCreate.
**Why:** Unstable references cause picker effects to re-fire on every render, which during remounts after tree view toggles creates validation cascades and re-render loops. Memoization stabilizes references; idempotent clearing prevents duplicate state updates.
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build` passed
- ✅ Focused Playwright create-form tests passed
- ✅ No material regressions found
**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/generic/GenericTagPicker.tsx`
- `src/components/requestParameterDetails/RequestParameterCreate.tsx`
- `src/components/responsePropertyDetails/ResponsePropertyCreate.tsx`

### 2026-05-24: React #185 Fix — Approved
**By:** Ripley (Lead)  
**What:** Reviewed and approved Dallas's GenericTagPicker refactor and picker state stability fix for React #185 regression.
**Why:** The reported React #185 loop was caused by unstable picker item arrays plus stale-selection clearing that could re-fire parent updates during remounts. Dallas fixed both sides: form-level picker items are memoized, and GenericTagPicker now clears stale selections through a ref-backed callback with an idempotence guard. The picker also correctly avoids clearing while the option list is temporarily empty, which is important for tree view modal remount/loading gaps.
**Guidance for Future Work:**
- Do not pass inline `map(...).sort(...)` arrays into GenericTagPicker.
- Any picker effect that can call back into parent state must be idempotent across remounts.
**Files Approved:**
- `src/components/generic/GenericTagPicker.tsx`
- `src/components/requestParameterDetails/RequestParameterCreate.tsx`
- `src/components/responsePropertyDetails/ResponsePropertyCreate.tsx`
**Build Status:** ✅ `npm run build` passed

### 2026-05-24: Response Property Tree-View Create State Reset (Follow-up)
**By:** Lambert (Tester)  
**What:** Validated and traced React #185 regression specific to response-property tree-view create/create-again scenarios (distinct from earlier GenericTagPicker fix).
**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Shared conditional render block for RequestParameterDetails and ResponsePropertyDetails causes simultaneous mount/unmount
2. TanStack Query cache with `staleTime: Infinity` persists across unmount/remount without invalidation
3. Component-level `lastHandledCreationRequestToken` ref resets on mount, creating race condition with dual component initialization
**Regression Scenarios:**
- Scenario 1: Create Request Parameter → Toggle Tree View → Create Response Property
- Scenario 2: Create Response Property → Toggle Tree View → Create Response Property Again
- Scenario 3: Rapid tree-view toggles during creation
**Deliverable:** Regression checklist with three scenarios and DevTools inspection points for Dallas implementation.

### 2026-05-24: Response Property Tree-View Create State Reset — Implementation
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Hardened response-property tree-view create flow against React #185 follow-up failures by resetting persisted frontend state at tree/form handoff.
**Implementation (Four-Part):**
1. Clear `selectedResponsePropertyId` before opening create mode from `CustomApiTreeView`
2. Clone response-property query data at details boundary into `ResponsePropertyList` to prevent mutation of React Query-backed data
3. Reset create-dialog solution selection when dialog closes (avoid stale solution across consecutive creates)
4. Make Zustand setters for `selectedResponsePropertyId` and `editingComponent` idempotent
**Why:** Tree-view toggles unmount form components, but Zustand selection state and TanStack Query cache survive remount. Consecutive create attempts were re-entering with stale selection/dialog state. Resetting handoff state and avoiding no-op store writes is the safest frontend-only fix.
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build` passed
- ✅ Focused Playwright response-property suite: 7/7 tests passed (including remount regression scenario)
- ✅ No page errors or React #185 warnings

---

### 2026-05-24: Response Property Tree-View Fix — Approved
**By:** Ripley (Lead)  
**What:** Reviewed and approved Dallas's follow-up response-property fix for tree-view create/create-again React #185 regression.
**Reasoning:**
- Parent tree-view handoff now clears persisted response-property selection before detail panel remounts ✓
- Response-property list receives cloned array so in-render sorting cannot mutate React Query-backed data ✓
- Create dialog state resets on real open/close transitions, avoiding stale solution selection across consecutive creates ✓
- Store setters are idempotent, reducing no-op update churn during remount-heavy transitions ✓
**Validation:**
- Build: `npm run build` passed ✓
- Focused Playwright scenario: Create twice after tree-view remounts, no page errors ✓
- Regression checklist: All three scenarios covered and validated ✓
**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED** — No material regression found. Ready for merge.

### 2026-05-24: Tree View Entry Clears Child Selections
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev) + Ripley (Lead approval)
**What:** Added directive to clear persisted child selections when entering tree view: both `selectedRequestParameterId` and `selectedResponsePropertyId` are cleared by `useEffect` in `CustomApiDetails.tsx` when `showTreeView` becomes true.
**Directive Source:** User request captured 2026-05-24T17:03:44.617-04:00
**Why:** Tree view hides request-parameter and response-property detail panes; retaining child selections creates stale UI state with no visible owner. Clearing selections keeps tree/form transitions consistent.
**Implementation:**
- Single `useEffect` in `CustomApiDetails.tsx` watches `showTreeView` flag
- Clears both store IDs when entering tree view
- No impact on form-view flows or create/edit logic beyond requested store cleanup
**Validation:**
- Build: `npm run build` passed ✓
- Focused regression: Response-property remount scenario passed ✓
**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED** by Ripley — Safe and complete for requested scope.

### 2026-05-24: TreeView Edit Action Regression Checklist — Documented
**By:** Lambert (Tester)  
**What:** Analyzed required state transitions and documented comprehensive regression checklist for Dallas's TreeView Edit handoff implementation.
**Scope:** Edit actions on unmanaged request parameters and response properties in CustomApiTreeView component.
**Key Findings:**
- Expected handoff flow: Edit button click → tree view exits + pending ID stored → form component mounts → detects pending ID → selects item → enters edit mode
- Critical handoff points: tree view toggle, selection set, form auto-enter edit, editing lock, data binding
- 58+ validation checkpoints across 9 test phases (component changes, form integration, edge cases, regression)
- DevTools validation steps for Zustand state, React Query, Profiler, network inspection
- Known behavioral baselines and regression risk assessment
**Decision:** ✅ **DOCUMENTED** — Checklist ready for implementation validation.

---

### 2026-05-24: Prior React #185 Fix Attempts — Audit Complete
**By:** Ripley (Lead) + Lambert (Tester)  
**What:** Audited response-property hardening decisions and confirmed root cause of React #185 regression.
**Root Cause Confirmed:** Stale persisted child selection surviving transition into tree view caused remount-time reconciliation failures and validation cascades.
**Keep Decisions:**
- Tree-view entry cleanup that clears both child IDs (prevents stale selection persistence)
- Response-property list array cloning (prevents React Query data mutation via in-render sort)
- Create-dialog solution reset on open/close (prevents stale carryover between consecutive creates)
- Store setter idempotence (reduces no-op subscriber churn during remounts)
**Future Cleanup:**
- Redundant `setSelectedResponsePropertyId(null)` inside `handleCreateResponsePropertyFromTree` can be removed once verified
**Rationale:** Each kept piece of hardening protects independent correctness concerns beyond the initial fix. Removing would reintroduce edge-case failures in specific remount sequences.
**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED** — Confirmed safety and completeness of prior fixes.

---

### 2026-05-24: TreeView Edit Handoff Implementation — Approved
**By:** Ripley (Lead) + Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Implemented TreeView Edit actions for existing request parameters and response properties with two-phase handoff and full Playwright coverage.
**Scope Reviewed:**
- `src/components/customApiDetails/CustomApiTreeView.tsx` - Added Edit button callbacks for unmanaged items
- `src/components/customApiDetails/CustomApiDetails.tsx` - Parent-level handoff logic (exit tree, store pending ID, trigger form select)
- `src/components/requestParameterDetails/RequestParameterDetails.tsx` - Detect pending ID, auto-enter edit after mount
- `src/components/requestParameterDetails/RequestParametersList.tsx` - Guard selection updates for consistency
- `src/components/responsePropertyDetails/ResponsePropertyDetails.tsx` - Detect pending ID, auto-enter edit after mount
- `src/components/responsePropertyDetails/ResponsePropertyList.tsx` - Guard selection updates for consistency
- `src/store/useAppStore.ts` - Idempotent setters for selected*Id and editingComponent
- `tests/e2e/specs/request-parameter.spec.ts` + `response-property.spec.ts` - Edit action coverage
**Why Approved:**
- Edit actions limited to unmanaged items (consistent with existing form-view edit constraints)
- Parent-level handoff state cleanly bridges tree-view-to-form remount boundary without forcing tree to own form mode
- Child detail panels only enter edit mode after requested record is selected and available (avoids React #185 racing)
- Focused Playwright coverage proves both request-parameter and response-property edit entry paths
- No material regression against prior fixes (React #185, GenericTagPicker, response-property create)
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build` passed
- ✅ `npm run test:e2e` passed: 33 passed, 3 skipped
- ✅ Focused request-parameter and response-property edit specs passing
**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED** — Safe, complete, and validated for requested TreeView Edit behavior.

### 2026-05-24: TreeView Return Flow — Architecture Decision
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Established the parent-owned return-to-tree intent pattern. When a create/edit action is launched from `CustomApiTreeView`, the parent container (CustomApiDetails) owns a completion callback that returns to tree view after the action finishes. Child detail panels receive an optional callback and invoke it only on **successful save** or **form cancel**.
**Why:** The parent already owns `showTreeView`, making it the safest place to preserve tree-vs-form intent. Tree-originated flows need different exit behavior than standard form flows; an optional callback keeps non-tree paths unchanged. Treating create-dialog cancel as "still editing" avoids accidentally dismissing the form before the user has cancelled the actual create action.
**Scope:**
- `src/components/customApiDetails/CustomApiDetails.tsx` - Parent handoff logic
- `src/components/customApiDetails/CustomApiTreeView.tsx` - Tree action initiators
- `src/components/requestParameterDetails/RequestParameterDetails.tsx` - Optional callback invocation
- `src/components/responsePropertyDetails/ResponsePropertyDetails.tsx` - Optional callback invocation
**Pattern:** Tree-originated request/response create/edit actions set intent flags before toggling tree view OFF, then invoke completion callbacks only on save/cancel from the child. Non-tree flows unaffected (no callback passed).
**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED** (architectural pattern established).

---

### 2026-05-24: TreeView Return Flow — Implementation Review V1 (Rejected)
**By:** Ripley (Lead)  
**What:** Reviewed Dallas's initial implementation of parent-owned return-to-tree intent and identified critical flag-lifecycle gap.
**Rejection Reason:** `returnToTreeViewAfterRequestParameterAction` and `returnToTreeViewAfterResponsePropertyAction` flags are set when tree-originated child actions begin but cleared only from child `onActionFinished` callbacks. The Tree/Form switch remains usable while those child forms are active. If the user manually toggles back to tree view before saving/canceling, the child component unmounts and the flag survives unchanged. On a later non-tree request/response action, that stale flag still injects the completion callback, causing save/cancel to unexpectedly bounce the user back to tree view.
**Scope Reviewed:**
- `src/components/customApiDetails/CustomApiDetails.tsx`
- `src/components/customApiDetails/CustomApiTreeView.tsx`
- `src/components/requestParameterDetails/RequestParameterDetails.tsx`
- `src/components/responsePropertyDetails/ResponsePropertyDetails.tsx`
- Related test files
**Required Revision:**
1. Clear tree-return flags on every path that exits child form mode without invoking the child save/cancel callback.
2. Ensure manual Tree/Form toggling cannot leak tree-origin intent into later non-tree actions.
3. Add Playwright regression proving: tree-origin action starts → user toggles back to tree view before finishing → user returns to form view and starts a non-tree action → save/cancel does **not** bounce to tree view.
**Validation Performed:** `npm run build` ✅, focused Playwright suites ✅
**Decision:** 🔴 **REJECTED FOR REVISION** — Close but not safe enough; designated Kane as revision owner.

### 2026-05-24: TreeView Return Intent Reset — Revision Decision
**By:** Kane (Backend/Backend-Revision Owner)  
**Decision:** When `CustomApiDetails` re-enters tree view, it must clear request/response tree-return intent and any pending child handoff state before later form actions begin.
**Why:** Tree-origin return behavior is a one-action intent, not durable UI state. If a user abandons a tree-launched child form by manually toggling back to tree view, the child unmounts without calling its normal save/cancel completion callback. Leaving the parent flags or pending handoff ids in place causes later form-originated request/response actions to inherit stale `onActionFinished` behavior or replay abandoned handoffs.
**Implementation Guidance:**
- Keep return-intent booleans owned by `CustomApiDetails`
- On every transition into tree view, clear:
  - `returnToTreeViewAfterRequestParameterAction`
  - `returnToTreeViewAfterResponsePropertyAction`
  - `requestParameterCreateTrigger`
  - `responsePropertyCreateTrigger`
  - `requestParameterEditId`
  - `responsePropertyEditId`
- Continue clearing child selections on tree entry
- Preserve save/cancel return-to-tree behavior only when the active action genuinely originated from the tree
**Validation:** `npm run build` ✅, focused Playwright regression for request-parameter and response-property manual-toggle leak scenarios ✅
**Decision:** ✅ **DECISION RECORDED** — Ready for implementation.

---

### 2026-05-24: TreeView Return Flow — Implementation Review V2 (Approved)
**By:** Ripley (Lead)  
**What:** Reviewed Kane's revised implementation of tree-return-to-tree intent reset and approved for merge.
**Why Approved:** Kane fixed the specific rejection gap cleanly at the parent boundary in `CustomApiDetails.tsx`: entering tree view now clears both child return-to-tree flags and the queued request/response create-edit handoff state together before a later form action can reuse them. The child detail panels still return to tree only on successful save or explicit cancel, so ordinary form-originated flows remain unchanged.
**Regression Coverage:** The focused Playwright regressions in request-parameter and response-property suites cover the previously missing manual-toggle path: start from tree, abandon the child form by toggling back to tree, return to form view, then start a normal header action and confirm cancel/save stays in form view. Existing custom API tree-edit coverage remains sufficient because the Tree/Form switch is only rendered in `mode === 'read'`, so that specific manual-toggle leak path is not reachable while the parent edit form is active.
**Scope Reviewed:**
- `src/components/customApiDetails/CustomApiDetails.tsx`
- `src/components/customApiDetails/CustomApiTreeView.tsx`
- `src/components/requestParameterDetails/RequestParameterDetails.tsx`
- `src/components/responsePropertyDetails/ResponsePropertyDetails.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/specs/request-parameter.spec.ts` + `response-property.spec.ts` (new regressions)
- `tests/e2e/specs/custom-api.spec.ts`
**Validation Performed:**
- ✅ `npm run build` passed
- ✅ Focused Playwright tree-return regressions (`request-parameter.spec.ts` + `response-property.spec.ts`) passed
- ✅ Existing custom API tree-edit return test passed
- ⚠️ Unrelated baseline e2e failures remain in `tests/e2e/specs/custom-api.spec.ts`
**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR MERGE** — Kane resolved the rejected flag-lifecycle gap without introducing new material issues in reviewed flows. Tree-origin return intent is now properly transient, scoped per action, not durable state.

### 2026-05-25: Custom API Selector Auto-Collapse on Selection
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Implemented auto-collapse of `CustomApiSelector` Filters section whenever `selectedCustomApiId` becomes truthy.
**Why:** The selected Custom API becomes the primary focus after pick time, so collapsing the secondary filter panel returns space to the details workflow. Limiting the behavior to selection events preserves existing non-selection behavior, including manual filter expansion when no API is selected.
**Implementation Notes:**
- Added a small `useEffect` in `src/components/CustomApiSelector.tsx` that sets `filtersExpanded` to `false` when a Custom API is selected.
- Added focused Playwright coverage in `tests/e2e/specs/custom-api.spec.ts` that asserts the selector card combobox count drops from 2 to 1 after selection.
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build`
- ✅ Focused Playwright: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/custom-api.spec.ts`
**Decision:** ✅ **DECISION RECORDED** — Auto-collapse on selection now active.

---

### 2026-05-25: New Custom API Should Collapse Selector Filters
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Treat entering Custom API create mode as the same UX milestone as selecting an existing Custom API: collapse the sibling Filters section in `CustomApiSelector`.
**Why:** Once the user clicks `New Custom API`, the workflow focus shifts from browsing/filtering to authoring details, so keeping the filter panel expanded wastes vertical space. The create flow already sets shared store state via `editingComponent = 'customapi'`, which gives the selector a stable, frontend-only signal without changing service contracts.
**Implementation Notes:**
- Updated `src/components/CustomApiSelector.tsx` so the auto-collapse effect runs when either `selectedCustomApiId` is truthy or `editingComponent === 'customapi'`.
- This preserves existing manual toggle behavior because the effect only reacts to selection/create-entry state changes, not filter toggles.
- Added Playwright coverage in `tests/e2e/specs/custom-api.spec.ts` to verify clicking `New Custom API` reduces the selector card from two comboboxes to one while showing the create form.
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build`
- ✅ `npm run test:e2e`
**Decision:** ✅ **DECISION RECORDED** — Create-mode collapse now active.

---

### 2026-05-25: Catalog Selector Managed Filter Summary Scope
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Added a dedicated Catalog managed/unmanaged toggle to `CatalogSelector.tsx` and aligned its collapsed badge summary/count with the actual catalog filter state.
**Why:** Root catalog availability is directly affected by the catalog managed-state toggle, so it should surface as an active filter badge. The Solution managed-state toggle still only scopes the solution picker, so it remains contextual and does not count as its own active filter.
**Scope:**
- `showCatalogs` state initialized to `'all'` (type: `ManagedStateFilter`)
- Filter logic: `filteredCatalogs = rootCatalogs?.filter(c => showCatalogs === 'all' || (c.ismanaged && showCatalogs === 'managed') || (!c.ismanaged && showCatalogs === 'unmanaged'))`
- Active filter count: `(selectedSolutionId ? 1 : 0) + (showSolutions !== 'all' ? 1 : 0) + (showCatalogs !== 'all' ? 1 : 0)`
- Badge display: "Managed Catalogs" or "Unmanaged Catalogs" with lock icons
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/CatalogSelector.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/specs/catalog-selector.spec.ts`
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build`
- ✅ Focused Playwright: `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/specs/catalog-selector.spec.ts`
**Decision:** ✅ **DECISION RECORDED** — Catalog filter now counts as standalone active filter, distinct from contextual Solution filter.

**Test Checklist:** 31 manual verification steps covering expansion, toggle states, catalog updates, filter counting, badge display, solution integration, edge cases, and accessibility.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All regression points pass manual verification
- ✅ Filter behavior mirrors CustomApiSelector pattern exactly
- ✅ Icon and badge styling consistent with existing design
- ✅ No visual UI state corruption during rapid interactions
- ✅ Empty state messaging displays appropriately
- ✅ Collapsed summary accurately reflects active filters

3. **Managed Toggle During Selection:** Stay collapsed (Option B) — consistent with filter-change behavior
**Test Case Categories:**
- Critical (1): Selecting Custom API auto-collapses filter section
- High (6): Filter summary, manual expand, changing selection, filter changes, solution selection, managed toggle
- Medium (7): Clear selection, initial state, no-API scenarios, rapid toggles, editing lock
- Low (2): Selection logs, empty list stability
**Files to Test:**
- `tests/e2e/specs/custom-api.spec.ts` — Add test suite "Custom API Selector Collapse"
- `tests/e2e/pages/app.page.ts` — Add helpers
**Decision:** ✅ **REGRESSION CHECKLIST RECORDED** — Ready for implementation and validation.

### 2026-05-25: QA Report — New Custom API Filter Collapse Behavior
**By:** Lambert (Tester)  
**What:** Traced expected behavior for clicking "New Custom API" in the Custom API Details header and identified gap in filter collapse behavior.
**Findings:**
- Clicking "New Custom API" → `handleCreate()` calls `setSelectedCustomApiId(null)` → Should trigger filter collapse
- Current collapse useEffect only triggers when `selectedCustomApiId` is truthy
- When "New Custom API" is clicked, `selectedCustomApiId` becomes null → collapse does not trigger
- Related paths also affected: Delete operation, Manual selection clear
**Code Path Traced:**
1. Button Click → `CustomApiDetails.tsx:401`
2. handleCreate() → Sets `selectedCustomApiId(null)`, `setCreateData()`, `setMode('create')`, `setEditingComponent('customapi')`
3. Collapse useEffect only checks if `selectedCustomApiId` is truthy → Misses null transition
**Regression Checklist (8 test cases):**
- ✅ Core: Selecting existing API collapses filter (passing)
- ⚠️ Feature Gap: New API button collapse (not tested)
- ⚠️ Related: Delete operation collapse (not tested)
- ✅ Inverse: Filters remain expanded on unrelated actions
- 🔄 State Consistency: Multiple selections/clears, create cancel
- 🔍 Edge Cases: Filter state during edit, no re-expand on cancel
**Recommendations:**
1. **High Priority:** Add E2E test for "New Custom API button collapses filter section"
2. **Medium Priority:** Test delete operation and manual clear collapse
3. **Low Priority:** Verify filter state persistence intuitive
**Implementation Fix Required:**
- Collapse trigger should account for `editingComponent === 'customapi'` in addition to truthy `selectedCustomApiId`
**Decision:** ✅ **QA REPORT RECORDED** — Implementation gap identified, fix guidance provided.

### 2026-05-25: Business Event Selector Filter Expand/Collapse Behavior
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Implemented auto-expand of `CatalogSelector` filters when the Business Events nav item becomes active, and auto-collapse when a catalog is selected.
**Why:** Users should land in browse/filter mode when entering Business Events navigation. Once a catalog is selected, the focus shifts to details viewing, so the filter panel collapses to reclaim space. Preserves manual filter toggling after both auto-expand and auto-collapse behaviors.
**Implementation Details:**
- Added `useEffect` in `src/components/CatalogSelector.tsx` to expand filters when Business Events nav item becomes active
- Auto-collapse filters only when `selectedCatalogId` changes to a new non-null value, preserving nav-entry expansion even if Zustand has an older catalog selected
- Manual filter toggle state survives both auto-expand and auto-collapse
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/CatalogSelector.tsx`
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build` passed
- ✅ Targeted E2E catalog selector tests passed
**Decision:** ✅ **DECISION RECORDED** — Feature implemented and ready for regression testing.

---

### 2026-05-25: Business Event Selector Filter UX — Regression Test Checklist
**By:** Lambert (Tester)  
**What:** Produced comprehensive UX specification and regression test checklist for Business Event selector filter expand/collapse behavior.
**Scope (5 scenarios, 13 test cases):**
1. **Filter Auto-Expand on Business Events Nav Entry** (3 tests) - Filters start expanded, summary hidden, manual toggle works
2. **Filter Auto-Collapse on Catalog Selection** (3 tests) - Selection collapses filters, summary reflects state, user can re-expand
3. **Filter State Changes Preserve Collapse** (3 tests) - Solution/Managed toggles while collapsed don't re-expand, badges update
4. **Unrelated Selector Interactions Don't Regress** (3 tests) - Custom API selector doesn't affect Business Event filters, manual preferences preserved
5. **Edge Cases** (3 tests) - Rapid selections, empty filters, solution-scoped empty states
**Test Implementation Notes:**
- Location: `tests/e2e/specs/catalog-selector.spec.ts`
- Mock data: Use existing `mockCatalogs`, `mockSolutions` from test fixtures
- Verification: DOM inspection (chevron direction), badge visibility, filter count regex matching
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All 5 scenarios pass
- ✅ No regressions in Custom API or other selector behaviors
- ✅ Filter toggle always responds to manual clicks
- ✅ Badge summary correctly reflects all active controls
- ✅ Collapse/expand state is deterministic (no thrashing)
**Decision:** ✅ **TEST SPECIFICATION APPROVED** — Ready for QA validation.

### 2026-05-29: About Section Removal
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Removed the About section end-to-end from navigation and app, including nav item entry, render branch, dedicated component file, and page-only styles.
**Why:** Keeps the nav model, rendered content switch, dedicated component file, and page-only styles aligned so the app has no dead About wiring to maintain. Avoids dead-code branches by fully removing all About references.
**Implementation:**
- Removed 'about' from `NavSection` type union in `App.tsx`
- Removed About nav item from `navItems` array
- Removed `case 'about':` from `renderContent()` switch statement
- Removed About component import
- Deleted `src/components/About.tsx` file
- Removed 6 unused About-only style definitions from `src/styles/Styles.ts`
- Added fallback logic: if `selectedNavItem === 'about'`, redirect to 'customapi' on mount
**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/App.tsx` (modified)
- `src/components/About.tsx` (deleted)
- `src/styles/Styles.ts` (modified)
- `tests/e2e/specs/smoke.spec.ts` (modified)
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build` passed
- ✅ Targeted smoke E2E tests passed (nav rendering, content switch, state fallback)
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED** — About section fully removed; stale nav fallback handled; ready for merge.

### 2026-05-29: About Section Removal — Regression Test Specification
**By:** Lambert (Tester)  
**What:** Produced comprehensive regression checklist for About section removal, covering 4 scenarios with 12 test cases.
**Scope:**
1. **Navigation Rendering** (3 tests) — Nav drawer renders 6 items, About absent, no visual gaps
2. **Navigation Click & Selection** (3 tests) — Clicking nav items updates state correctly, tab order correct, keyboard navigation works
3. **Content Rendering** (3 tests) — Switching between sections renders expected components, no console errors, message bar renders correctly
4. **Edge Cases & State Fallback** (3 tests) — Stale 'about' selection redirects to 'customapi', theme switcher works, hamburger collapse works
**Additional Checks:**
- Build & Compile Checks (3 checkpoints) — TypeScript compilation, Vite build, no unused imports
- Smoke Test Validation (3 checkpoints) — App loads without errors, FluentUI provider active, no 404s
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All 12 regression test cases pass
- ✅ TypeScript compiles cleanly
- ✅ About file and styles removed, no orphaned references
- ✅ Existing E2E tests still pass
- ✅ No console errors or visual regressions
**Decision:** ✅ **REGRESSION CHECKLIST RECORDED** — Ready for QA validation.

### 2026-05-29: Selector Init Settings — Feature Decision
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Added `customApiSelectionInit` and `businessEventSelectionInit` as app-level settings with default value `'all'`.
**Why:** Allow users to persist their preferred managed-state filter defaults (all, managed, unmanaged) for Custom API and Business Event selectors across sessions.
**Implementation:**
- Added both settings to `AppSettings` interface with `ManagedStateFilter` type ('all' | 'unmanaged' | 'managed')
- Reused `ManagedStateToggle` in `SettingsForm` so settings UI matches live selector control exactly
- Added `useEffect` in `CustomApiSelector` to initialize `showCustomApis` from `appSettings.customapiSelectionInit` on mount
- Added similar init logic for Business Event filter (`showBusinessEventsOnly`)
- Manual session-level filter changes are ephemeral (don't persist to settings)
**Files Changed:**
- `src/models/AppSettings.ts` (models updated)
- `src/components/settingsForm/SettingsForm.tsx` (UI added)
- `src/components/CustomApiSelector.tsx` (init effect added)
- `src/components/CatalogSelector.tsx` (init effect added)
**Validation:**
- ✅ `npm run build` passed
- ✅ Focused E2E tests for init settings passed
- ✅ Settings persist across reload
- ✅ Manual session changes reset on reload
**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED** — Selector init settings feature complete; settings drive only initial state on mount; session changes remain ephemeral.

### 2026-05-29: Selector Init Settings — UX/State Behavior Analysis
**By:** Lambert (Tester)  
**What:** Produced detailed UX specification and comprehensive regression checklist for selector init settings feature (10 phases, 80+ checkpoints).
**Coverage Areas:**
1. **AppSettings Model & Persistence** (6 checkpoints) — Interface includes new settings, defaults provided, persistence verified
2. **Settings Form Integration** (11 checkpoints) — Form renders new fields, uses ManagedStateToggle, values load correctly, Save/Reset work
3. **CustomApiSelector Initialization** (6 checkpoints) — Component reads appSettings on mount, applies init values, handles errors/undefined
4. **Filter Default Values (First Load)** (6 test cases) — Default 'all' behavior, 'managed' behavior, 'unmanaged' behavior
5. **Manual Filter Changes (Session Persistence)** (6 test cases) — Changes update UI, don't write to settings, reset on reload
6. **Business Event Filter Init Behavior** (2 test cases) — Semantic mapping of 'all'/'managed' to boolean `showBusinessEventsOnly`
7. **Settings Form Changes & Persistence** (3 test cases) — Change and save, verify new init takes effect, reset changes
8. **Edge Cases & Boundary Conditions** (4 test cases) — Settings load error, partial settings, rapid toggles, combined filter init + manual change
9. **Cross-Selector Integration** (2 test cases) — Filter independence, solution filter remains contextual
10. **Regression Baseline (No Regressions)** (6 checkpoints) — Existing selector behavior unchanged, no console errors, build succeeds, E2E tests pass
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All 80+ regression checkpoints pass
- ✅ No new console errors or React warnings
- ✅ `npm run build` succeeds
- ✅ Existing E2E tests pass
- ✅ Settings persist across reload
- ✅ Manual session changes reset on reload
**Decision:** ✅ **REGRESSION CHECKLIST RECORDED** — 80+ checkpoints ready for implementation validation.

### 2026-05-30: Custom API to Business Event Navigation — Implementation Pattern
**By:** Dallas (Frontend Dev)  
**What:** Implemented a shared `OpenBusinessEventAction` utility component that enables navigation from Custom API Details/Tester to Business Event view with the corresponding catalog assignment selected.
**Why:** Feature request from David Rivard. Need smart routing: direct jump for single assignment, chooser dialog for multiple assignments. Zustand handoff mechanism avoids fragile URL/local state encoding.
**Pattern Established:**
1. Query catalog assignments filtered by `_object_value@Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.lookuplogicalname === 'customapi'`
2. Single assignment (1): Set `pendingBusinessEventAssignmentId` + navigate to Business Event directly
3. Multiple assignments (2+): Show chooser dialog; user selects one to navigate
4. In `BusinessEventDetails`: Wait for catalogs + assignments to load, derive root catalog from assignment category, select in tree, clear pending ID on unmount
5. Cleanup: Clear pending ID when leaving Business Event view to prevent abandoned handoff replay
**Integration Points:**
- `CustomApiDetailsRead` component: Add button to action area
- `CustomApiTester` nav: Add button to header (if applicable)
- `BusinessEventDetails` component: Add pending ID resolution + cleanup logic
- `useAppStore`: Add `pendingBusinessEventAssignmentId` state
- Generic action component: `src/components/generic/OpenBusinessEventAction.tsx`
**Implementation Notes:**
- Zustand handoff is ephemeral; cleared on nav away
- Tree selection reconstructed from assignment metadata (category → root catalog mapping)
- No changes to existing Custom API/Business Event workflows
**Build Status:** ✅ TypeScript compilation passed, Vite build passed
**Decision:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** — Ready for QA validation from Lambert.

### 2026-05-30: QA Specification — Custom API to Business Event Jump Feature
**By:** Lambert (Tester)  
**What:** Produced comprehensive QA specification with 12 end-to-end test scenarios covering all usage patterns, edge cases, and accessibility requirements.
**Coverage Areas:**
1. **Scenario 1: No Assignment** — Button hidden when Custom API has zero catalog assignments
2. **Scenario 2: Single Assignment** — Direct navigation without dialog; button label, icon, placement verified
3. **Scenario 3: Multiple Assignments** — Dialog/modal presents all assigned catalogs with names, hierarchy, managed state; user selects one to jump
4. **Scenario 4: Mixed Managed/Unmanaged** — Lock icons and state indicators distinguish managed vs unmanaged catalogs in dialog
5. **Scenario 5: State Preservation** — Custom API selection persists when user returns to Custom API view after jump
6. **Scenario 6: Tester Integration** — Jump button behavior mirrors Details view (if button appears in Tester nav)
7. **Scenario 7: Solution Context** — Button shows only assignments relevant to currently selected solution
8. **Scenario 8: Object Type Awareness** — Assignments filtered correctly by `objectname='customapi'` (exclude other object types)
9. **Scenario 9: Loading & Error States** — Async queries handled gracefully; button shows loading state or disables until assignments load; errors logged
10. **Scenario 10: Accessibility** — Fluent UI v9 conventions, keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter/Space), ARIA labels for screen readers, theme compliance
11. **Scenario 11: Multi-Assignment Dialog UX** — Dialog title, scrollable list, clickable items with hover/focus states, Cancel button, Escape key support, correct z-index
12. **Scenario 12: Regression Testing** — No impact on existing Custom API CRUD, Details fields, Tester execution, Business Event tree view, CatalogAssignment operations, solution selector, or E2E test suite
**Test Data Requirements:**
- Custom API with 0 assignments
- Custom API with 1 assignment
- Custom API with 2+ assignments (ideally mixed managed/unmanaged)
- Catalog hierarchy with Root > Category structure
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All 12 scenarios have clear, executable test cases
- ✅ Design clarifications from David received
- ✅ Button placement, label, dialog UX approved
- ✅ No console errors across all scenarios
- ✅ Keyboard navigation and accessibility verified
- ✅ Light/dark theme rendering tested
- ✅ All E2E regression tests pass
**Decision:** ✅ **QA SPECIFICATION COMPLETE** — Awaiting design clarifications from David before validation execution.

### 2026-05-30: Design Clarifications Needed — Custom API Business Event Jump Feature
**By:** Lambert (Tester)  
**To:** David Rivard (Requestor)  
**What:** Identified 5 critical design ambiguities that must be clarified before QA can fully validate Dallas's implementation.
**Clarifications Requested:**
1. **Button Placement & Visibility** — Where should button appear? (inline in form, action button in card header, or separate section?) Should it appear in Tester view? What label and icon?
2. **Multiple Assignment UX** — When 2+ assignments exist, use: (A) modal dialog with catalog list, (B) dropdown menu, or (C) auto-jump to first? Should dialog show hierarchy context (Root > Category)? Include solution name?
3. **State Preservation** — After navigating to Business Event, should Custom API selection remain preserved for back-jump, or clear on nav away?
4. **Managed vs Unmanaged Handling** — Should managed/unmanaged state conflict disable the button? Any special handling needed?
5. **Cross-Solution Assignments** — Show only assignments from current solution, or show all regardless? Disable if no assignments in current solution?
**Status:** ⏸️ Awaiting answers to proceed with validation  
**Impact:** Answers drive QA test case refinement and implementation adjustments  
**Next Steps:** Once clarifications received, Lambert will refine QA checklist and execute 12-scenario validation suite.
**Decision:** ⏸️ **CLARIFICATIONS REQUIRED** — Dallas implementation pending David's design decision answers.
